rock climbing equipment
some metal gears
some plant seeds
some slugs
some stale crackers
suspicious gloop
the discovery of a scenic picnic spot
the discovery of a sunken pirate ship! Alas, there was no booty
worthless paintings
the discovery of a half buried temple. Unfortunately there was no way in
a phony coin
a sense of existential dread
a neat pebble
a comically large stick
a bunch of mysterious feathers
the memory of a nice walk
possibly magic beans
plaster casts of some frighteningly large footprints
a new diary entry
a clue
a thorn in their paw
a tasty snack
mud on their paws

a sense of purpose
fleas
a new trick they learned
a candle that won't go out
some pyrite they're sure is gold
someone's lost Mith plushie

rumors of a hidden cache of treasures
a clay jar full of dust
a kite
a scroll dropped by a passing dragon courier
a spring in their step
a roc's tail feather
a dandelion
one piece of a jigsaw puzzle
nothing... or did they? No, yeah, nothing
a song in their heart
some baby's candy
the shell of a dragon egg
something stuck in their teeth
a Serthis's shed skin
a big tasty fish
enchanted gold, which disappears during the night
a weird smell
the sense they're being followed
a tendril of shadow..
the stink of defeat
a sack of potatos
a shed antler
a bone to chew on
